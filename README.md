Blender interface theme that tries to mimic The Foundry's MODO interface colors. The first version (for Blender 2.7x) was based on "official" [Modo theme](https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-extensions/contrib/py/scripts/addons/presets/interface_theme/modo.xml "Modo theme on Blender Wiki"), but heavily modified, hence the name MOMO (**MO**dified **MO**do). This version is for Blender 3.x versions and is based on previous version.

## Installation
1. Clone or download ZIP
2. (optional) Extract .zip
3. Open Blender User Preferences (Themes tab)
4. Click "Install Theme..." and select __momo.xml__ file
